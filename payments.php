            <p>Yes, we use industry standard SSL encryption to protect your details. Potentially sensitive information such as your name, address and card details are encoded so they can only be read on the secure server</p>
            <p>Also all payment information is <strong> securely stored and processed via a third party payment processor </strong>so it makes no contact with our servers or databases.</p>
